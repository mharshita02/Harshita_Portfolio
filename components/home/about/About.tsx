              Hey there! Welcome to my portfolio! I&apos;m a Recent Graduate
              I am a recent graduate in Information Technology from Gautam Buddha
              University with a CGPA of 9.20, offering a strong foundation in Java, HTML,
              CSS, and JavaScript, coupled with hands-on experience in software
              development through projects and internships.
              <br />
              <br />
              I&apos;m really good at using HTML , CSS , Bootstrap, JS, JAVA, Spring Boot(Basic) & SQL.
              These tools help me be super creative and bring fresh ideas to
              every project.

              I know a bunch of other cool stuff too, like Tailwind CSS, regular
              CSS, SCSS, styled-components, and CSS modules. With these tools, I
              can make websites that look great and work perfectly on any
              device. Whether it&apos;s making sure everything looks good on a
              phone or making websites load super fast, I&apos;m all about
              making sure people have a great experience.

              During my internship at Oasis Infobyte, I developed Java applications
              across various phases, analyzing software requirements, writing
              maintainable code, and debugging issues. This experience sharpened my
              problem-solving abilities and deepened my understanding of the software
              development lifecycle.

              My technical skills are further evidenced by projects like the Bank
              Management System and ATM Simulator System, where I implemented
              functionalities such as depositing, withdrawing, and producing
              mini-statements. Additionally, I created a Dribbble Clone that showcases
              my proficiency in front-end development, focusing on responsive design
              and cross-browser compatibility
